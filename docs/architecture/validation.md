# Validation System

Validation is a **local lifecycle gate**, not a CI system.

## Model

- Run one quick local command while the coding/review loop is active
- Run one deeper publish command before push/publish
- Cache passing results by worktree + commit SHA + command
- Reuse passing publish records across pre-publish and pre-push hooks
- Observe GitHub CI rather than reproducing it locally

## Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
validation:
  quick:
    # Fast feedback for coding-done and local coder/reviewer exchanges.
    # Put cheap repo policy scans here too, for example rejecting new
    # test skips such as assumeTrue/assumeFalse/@Disabled/@Ignore.
    cmd: "make validate-quick"
    timeout_seconds: 300
  publish:
    # Authoritative local PR/pre-push gate.
    cmd: "make validate-pr-raw"
    timeout_seconds: 1800
    dirty_check: tracked

execution:
  isolation:
    mode: "standard"   # or "hardened"
```

`validation.quick.cmd` should be fast enough to run whenever an agent reports
`coding-done completed` and between local coder/reviewer rounds. It should catch
cheap correctness and policy failures early while the coding agent can still
respond immediately.

`validation.publish.cmd` should be the same command your repository treats as
its authoritative pre-push / pre-publish gate.

Keep quick and publish commands configured separately so active review loops can
stay responsive while push/publish actions still run the deeper repository gate.

If the user-facing gate command itself calls the cache-aware pre-push wrapper,
configure `validation.publish.cmd` to the underlying raw command instead. For
example, this repository exposes `make validate-pr` as the cache-aware entry
point and configures `validation.publish.cmd: make validate-pr-raw`, a public
non-recursive target that runs the same required suite without re-entering
`scripts/verify-pr.sh`, so the wrapper can seed and reuse the cache without
re-entering itself.

The old single-command shape (`validation.cmd`,
`validation.timeout_seconds`, and `validation.pre_push_dirty_check`) is rejected
at config load time. That keeps upgrades visible instead of silently disabling
both lifecycle gates.

When you install repo guardrails with `issue-orchestrator setup-guardrails`, the
generated `scripts/verify-pr.sh` captures the selected config filename. If you
switch the repo to a different `.issue-orchestrator/config/modes/<mode>/*.yaml`, rerun
`setup-guardrails` so pre-push validation and cache lookups continue to use the
same config.

The canonical **pre-publish** gate is the worktree's effective `pre-push` hook:

- project hook first (`make validate-pr`, `scripts/verify-pr.sh`, etc.)
- orchestrator hook second (Agent-Status trailer + dirty-tree policy)

The orchestrator runs that hook chain before the authenticated push so
push-time policy failures are discovered before publish. The real push still
keeps hooks enabled; when the commit and configured command match, the later
hook pass reuses the cached publish validation record instead of rerunning the
command. CI still mirrors the repo's required PR coverage in a clean
environment.

## Runtime Artifact Ignores

Dirty-tree guards ignore orchestrator-managed runtime files so agents are not
blocked by session state, local tool caches, or Claude Code scheduling locks.
Built-in ignores cover `.issue-orchestrator/` runtime state and
`.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`.

Target repositories can add repo-local runtime artifacts in
`.issue-orchestrator/runtime-ignore`. See
[`docs/user/configuration.md`](../user/configuration.md#ignore-repo-local-runtime-artifacts)
for the supported format and operator guidance.

## Record Format

Location: `.issue-orchestrator/validation/<suite>/<HEAD_SHA>.json`

Record fields:
- `schema_version`
- `suite`
- `head_sha`
- `passed` + `exit_code`
- `command`
- `started_at` / `ended_at`
- `stdout`/`stderr` paths (optional but recommended)
